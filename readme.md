# 📌 Assignment: CSS Positioning Demo  

## **Task Overview**  
Apoorva, your task is to analyze and understand the **CSS Positioning Demo** project. This includes how different CSS positioning techniques are applied to elements like headers, side navigation, tables, and footers.  

### **Key Points to Focus On:**  
1. **Fixed Header** – Stays at the top while scrolling, contains a notification button.  
2. **Notification Button** – Has a badge for unread messages and a tooltip on hover.  
3. **Side Navigation** – Fixed sidebar on the left with navigation links.  
4. **Main Content** – Includes a **sticky table header** inside a scrollable container.  
5. **Fixed Footer** – Remains at the bottom of the viewport.  

### **Expected Outcome**  
- Review and understand how each positioning technique is applied.  
- Ensure elements behave as expected when scrolling.  
- Be ready to discuss insights or challenges faced while understanding the implementation.  

### **Important Note**  
🚨 **Do not** edit or refer to the `index.html` file. This file contains the final output.  
📝 Instead, write your code in `css.html` and apply the necessary styles there.
